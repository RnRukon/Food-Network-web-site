            <h1> <span class="orangered-color"> My </span>Rechipes</h1>
            <p>We tweaked these recipes until they were perfect. <br> Give them a try. We bet you'll agree.</p>
        </div>

                <h3>
                    Strawberry Shortcake
                </h3>
                <p>For our simple and iconic shortcake, we discovered a great double-stacking technique that creates
                    super light and high biscuits that are easy to split. This makes them easy to fill without
                    crumbling. A simple recipe like this one allows its ingredients to shine, so use the very best
                    berries you can find.

                    Chocolate Mousse
                </h3>
                <p>The best chocolate mousse must be perfect. It should taste rich, indulgent and not too sweet, with a
                    texture that is both light-and-airy and silky-and-smooth. After many attempts we nailed it and made
                    a dessert that not only exceeded our standards, it's also quite easy to pull off. Close your eyes
                    and take a bite — you'll be transported to a 4-star French restaurant.

                    Tricolore Stuffed Pork
                </h3>
                <p>The colors of the Italian flag — red, white and green — are well-represented in Giada's juicy pork
                    loin. The boneless meat is wrapped around layers of creamy provolone, sweet roasted red peppers and
                    vibrant spinach to create impressive results.
